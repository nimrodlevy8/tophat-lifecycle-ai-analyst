name: feedback-capture
description: Automatically capture user corrections, methodology learnings, and positive feedback to the knowledge system. Runs silently BEFORE Question Router on every user message. Also handles `/log-correction` for deliberate manual correction logging. Use this skill whenever the user corrects your work ("that's wrong", "actually it's...", "you should have..."), teaches a methodology ("next time...", "always use...", "never do..."), or confirms correctness ("that's right", "perfect", "good analysis"). Also trigger when users mention mistakes, errors, incorrect numbers, wrong columns, missing filters, double-counting, or any variant of "you forgot to..." or "it should be...". This skill learns from every correction to prevent repeating the same analytical mistakes. Captures to `.knowledge/corrections/` and `.knowledge/learnings/` automatically without blocking the pipeline.

# Skill: Feedback Capture

## Purpose
Pre-router interceptor that runs BEFORE Question Router on every user message.
Detects correction signals, methodology learnings, and positive feedback, captures
them to `.knowledge/`, then passes through to normal routing.

This is production code that runs on every message. It should be completely invisible
to the user — no output, no announcements, no execution reports.

## When to Use
- On every incoming user message, before Question Router classification
- Runs silently — the user should never notice this skill executing
- This is NOT a testing/demonstration context — it's real production behavior

## Instructions

### Step 0: Understand what "silent operation" means

This skill runs in production on every user message. The user should experience:
- Brief acknowledgment ("Got it, logged as CORR-X" or "Noted for future analyses")
- Immediate answer to their actual question
- NO execution reports, NO summaries of what the skill did

**What you will produce:**
```
Got it, logged as CORR-008. Here's the corrected Q4 conversion rate using order_total:
[analysis results here]
```

**What you will NOT produce:**
```
# Feedback Capture Skill Output
## Execution Summary
Task: User provided a correction...
Actions Taken: 1. Detected correction signal...
```

If you create sections like "Execution Summary", "Skill Behavior Verification",
"Correction Logged", or any meta-commentary about the skill's operation, you have
failed. The skill's job is to capture silently and let the analyst do their work.

**Critical**: Wrap all logic in try/except. If anything fails, pass through silently
to Question Router. Never block the pipeline.

### Step 1: Detect feedback type

Scan the user's message for these signal patterns:

**Correction signals** (user says something was wrong):
- "that's wrong", "that's incorrect", "actually it's...", "it should be..."
- "the column is X not Y", "that number should be...", "you used the wrong..."
- "off by...", "overcounted", "undercounted", "double-counted"
- "that join is wrong", "missing a filter", "forgot to exclude..."

**Learning signals** (user teaches a reusable methodology):
- "next time...", "always use...", "never use...", "prefer X over Y"
- "the convention here is...", "our team uses...", "don't forget to..."
- "a better approach would be...", "going forward...", "remember that..."

**Positive signals** (user confirms correctness):
- "that's right", "exactly", "perfect", "good analysis", "looks good"

**No signal**: If no pattern matched, pass through silently. If multiple match,
prioritize: Correction > Learning > Positive.

### Step 2: Act on detection

#### If Correction detected:

1. Read `.knowledge/corrections/index.yaml` to get `last_correction_id`.
2. Compute next ID: increment the numeric suffix (e.g., `CORR-001` -> `CORR-002`).
   If `last_correction_id` is null, start at `CORR-001`.
3. Estimate severity from context:
   - **critical**: Wrong conclusion presented to stakeholders
   - **high**: Wrong numbers in output, incorrect joins affecting results
   - **medium**: Wrong column, filter, or metric definition used
   - **low**: Minor label, formatting, or naming issue
4. Classify category: `join_error` | `filter_missing` | `metric_definition` |
   `date_range` | `aggregation` | `schema` | `logic` | `other`
5. Read `.knowledge/corrections/log.yaml`.
6. Append a new entry to the `corrections` list:
   ```yaml
   - id: "CORR-{N}"
     date: "{TODAY}"
     severity: "{estimated}"
     category: "{classified}"
     dataset: "{active dataset or null}"
     tables: []
     description: "{what the user said was wrong}"
     fix: "{what the user said is correct}"
     sql_before: null
     sql_after: null
     prevented_by: null
   ```
   Fill `tables`, `sql_before`, `sql_after`, and `prevented_by` only if the
   user's message contains enough detail. Leave null otherwise.
7. Write updated `log.yaml`.
8. Update `.knowledge/corrections/index.yaml`: increment `total_corrections`,
   increment the matching `by_severity` and `by_category` counts, set
   `last_correction_id` and `last_updated`.
9. Acknowledge briefly in your response: "Got it, logged as {ID}."
10. **Then immediately process the user's underlying request** — if they asked
    "that's wrong, the column is X not Y, now show me the correct analysis",
    you logged the correction AND you run the corrected analysis. Don't stop
    after logging.

#### If Learning detected:

1. Read `.knowledge/learnings/index.md`.
2. Classify into one of the six categories:
   - Data Patterns | Query Techniques | Business Context |
     Stakeholder Preferences | Visualization Insights | Methodology Notes
3. Append a bullet point under the matching `### {N}. {Category}` heading.
   Format: `- {concise learning} (source: user feedback, {TODAY})`
4. Write updated `index.md`.
5. Acknowledge briefly in your response: "Noted for future analyses."
6. **Then immediately process the user's underlying request** — if they said
   "next time exclude test users" as part of asking for a retention analysis,
   you log the learning AND you run the retention analysis with test users
   excluded.

#### If Positive feedback detected:

Acknowledge briefly in your response ("Thanks!" or similar) and continue processing
the rest of the message normally. No file writes needed.

**If the message contains a follow-up request after positive feedback** (e.g.,
"that looks perfect, now can you..."), proceed directly to fulfilling that request.

#### If No signal detected:

Pass through silently. Do NOT say "I didn't detect feedback." Proceed directly
to the Question Router for normal request processing.

### Step 3: Respond to the user (production output)

Your response to the user should feel natural and helpful. Examples:

**Correction with follow-up:**
```
Got it, logged as CORR-008. Here's the corrected Q4 2024 conversion rate using order_total:
- October: 89.02% conversion, $5,586.21 revenue
- November: 84.62% conversion, $3,110.90 revenue
- December: 86.81% conversion, $9,522.20 revenue
- Q4 Total: 86.85% conversion, $18,219.32 revenue

[SQL query here if relevant]
```

**Learning without follow-up:**
```
Noted for future analyses. I've updated the methodology to exclude test users
(email contains '@test.com' or user_id < 1000) in all retention calculations.
```

**Positive feedback with follow-up:**
```
Thanks! Here's the breakdown by device type:
[analysis results here]
```

**What NOT to include:**
- Section headers like "## Execution Summary" or "## Skill Behavior Verification"
- Descriptions of what the skill detected or how it classified the feedback
- File paths showing where data was saved
- Lists of "Actions Taken" or "File Changes"
- Meta-commentary about skill operation

The user cares about their ANALYSIS, not about your bookkeeping. The only mention
of feedback capture should be the brief acknowledgment line.

### Error handling

All detection and capture logic MUST be wrapped in try/except. If file reads or
writes fail, skip capture entirely and proceed to routing. The analyst's primary
job is answering questions, not bookkeeping.

If a file write fails, do NOT retry or announce the failure. Log nothing and
continue to the user's request as if feedback capture never ran.

## Anti-Patterns (Common Mistakes)

1. **Creating execution reports** -- Do NOT write sections like "## Execution Summary",
   "## Skill Behavior Verification", "## File Changes", "## What the user would see".
   These are meta-commentary. The user wants their ANALYSIS, not a report about your
   internal bookkeeping.

2. **Stopping after logging** -- Do NOT log the feedback and then stop. If the user
   asked "that's wrong, use column X, now show me the corrected analysis", you must
   do BOTH: log the correction AND run the corrected analysis in the same response.

3. **Announcing detection** -- Do NOT say "I detected a correction signal" or
   "feedback type classified as learning". Just acknowledge briefly and continue.

4. **Asking for confirmation** -- Do NOT ask "should I log this as a correction?"
   Classify silently and log.

5. **Blocking the pipeline** -- If file writes fail, skip silently and continue to
   the user's request. Never halt on logging errors.

6. **Fabricating details** -- Use `null` for correction fields you cannot infer from
   the user's message. Don't guess.

7. **Announcing non-detection** -- If no feedback was detected, pass through silently.
   Do NOT say "I didn't detect any feedback."

8. **Heavy processing** -- This runs on EVERY message. Keep it fast: pattern match,
   write files, acknowledge, continue. No complex analysis of the feedback itself.

## Examples of correct behavior

**Example 1: Correction with follow-up**
User: "Actually that conversion rate is wrong, you're using total_revenue when you should be using order_total. Show me the correct numbers."

Your response: "Got it, logged as CORR-004. Here's the corrected conversion rate using order_total: [runs analysis with correct column]"

**Example 2: Learning without follow-up**
User: "Next time when you're calculating retention always exclude test users where email contains '@test.com' or user_id < 1000."

Your response: "Noted for future analyses. I've updated the learnings system to exclude test users (email '@test.com' or user_id < 1000) in all retention calculations."

**Example 3: Positive feedback with follow-up**
User: "That analysis looks perfect! Can you now break it down by device type?"

Your response: "Thanks! Here's the breakdown by device type: [runs device segmentation analysis]"

**Example 4: No feedback signal**
User: "Show me revenue by category for Q4"

Your response: [proceeds directly to analysis, no mention of feedback capture]

## Manual Mode (`/log-correction`)

When the user explicitly invokes `/log-correction`, use the detailed correction
flow instead of the silent auto-detect:

1. **Gather details** — extract or ask for: what was wrong, correct answer,
   dataset/tables, severity (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`), SQL before/after.
   If severity is unclear, ask — do not guess.
2. **Categorize** — exactly ONE of: `sql` | `metric` | `schema` | `logic` | `other`.
   If the user suggests a non-standard category (e.g., "filter_missing"), map to
   the closest allowed category and confirm.
3. **Assign `prevented_by`** — which validation layer should have caught this:
   `structural`, `logical`, `business-rules`, `Simpson's check`, or `source tie-out`
4. **Write** — append to `.knowledge/corrections/log.yaml`, update `index.yaml`
   (increment `total_corrections`, matching `by_severity`/`by_category`, set
   `last_correction_id` and `last_updated`)
5. **Confirm** — report the ID, severity, category, description, and fix:
   ```
   Correction logged: CORR-{N}
     Severity: {severity} | Category: {category}
     Description: {description}
     Fix: {fix}
   ```
