name: export
description: Export analysis results in different formats for different audiences — email summaries, Slack updates, decision briefs, Google Docs with embedded charts, Word documents, slide decks, or raw data CSVs. Use this skill whenever someone says `/export`, "export this as...", "send this to...", "share this analysis", "create a Google Doc", "make a Word document", "I need this as a deck", "export the data", "write an email summary", "draft a Slack update", "create a brief", or mentions needing analysis outputs in a specific format for stakeholders. Also trigger after completing an analysis when the user wants to share results, when they mention audience needs (VP, team channel, product team), or when they want multiple output formats at once. This skill handles the full export workflow — finding source material, generating the requested format with proper structure, managing Google Workspace auth and uploads, version tracking for re-exports, and fallback handling when external services fail.

# Skill: Export

## Purpose
Export analysis results in different formats for different audiences. Converts
pipeline outputs into ready-to-share deliverables.

## Invocation
`/export slides` — generate/refresh Marp slide deck from latest analysis
`/export email` — write an executive summary email (markdown)
`/export slack` — write a concise Slack update (markdown)
`/export brief` — write a 1-page decision brief (markdown)
`/export data` — export analysis data tables as CSV
`/export gdoc` — create a Google Doc with full Analysis Readout (charts, SQL, bookmarks)
`/export docx` — generate a local .docx Word document (no Google upload)
`/export notion` — export analysis to a Notion page (with charts, data stamps, provenance toggles)
`/export receipt` — generate full analysis receipt (Reproduce-level audit trail)
`/export all` — generate all text formats + data (does NOT include gdoc, notion, or receipt — use `/export gdoc`, `/export notion`, and `/export receipt` separately)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Find Source Material

**Primary source detection** (use exactly ONE of these, in order):
1. `outputs/narrative_*.md` — if exists, use the **most recent by date** (check filename date suffix)
2. `outputs/analysis_*.md` — if narrative absent, use **most recent analysis**
3. `working/pipeline_summary.md` — if no outputs/ files exist
4. `working/storyboard_*.md` — last resort if above are all missing

**How to choose when multiple files exist:** Sort by filename date (YYYYMMDD or YYYY-MM-DD suffix), use the latest. If no date in filename, use file modification time.

**Supporting materials** (collect when available, but NOT primary source):
- `outputs/charts/*.png` — chart images
- `outputs/validation_*.md` — confidence score
- `outputs/close_the_loop_*.md` — success tracking + action items
- `working/sql_queries/*.sql` — SQL queries

**If no outputs exist:**
- Check `working/` for partial results
- If nothing found: "No analysis results to export. Run an analysis first or use `/run-pipeline`."

**Critical:** Once you identify the primary source, read it COMPLETELY before generating any export. Do not assume you know the content — always verify what analysis you're exporting.

### Step 2: Generate Requested Format

**Format: slides**
- If deck already exists, ask: "Deck found at {path}. Regenerate or export as-is?"
- If no deck, invoke Deck Creator agent with latest narrative + charts
- Output: `outputs/slides_{DATE}.md`

**Format: email**
- Structure: Subject line + 3-paragraph body (context, key finding, recommendation)
- Tone: Executive-friendly, no jargon, action-oriented
- Include: 1-2 key numbers, the "so what", and a clear ask
- **Content source:** Use ONLY findings from the source narrative — do not calculate derived metrics (e.g., revenue impact) unless they appear in the source. Simplify technical findings, but never fabricate numbers.
- **Output file:** Write the email content to `outputs/email_summary_{DATE}.md` where {DATE} is today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., `email_summary_2026-04-04.md`). This specific file path is important for consistent organization.

**Format: slack**
- Structure: ONE focused update with bold headline + 3-5 bullet points
- Keep under 300 words, thread-friendly format
- Use emoji sparingly (checkmarks, arrows only)
- Include: key metric, direction, and recommended action
- Include a data stamp for each key finding (abbreviated format): `50K | Jan-Mar 2026 | EVENTS | B (82)`
- **Content source:** Extract directly from the source narrative — use exact numbers and findings. Do not reinterpret or add context not present in the source.
- Do not create multiple versions (Full/Short/Executive) — produce one concise update that works for team channels
- **Output file:** Write to `outputs/slack_update_{DATE}.md` where {DATE} is today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., `slack_update_2026-04-04.md`)

**Format: brief**
- Structure: Title + Executive Summary (3 sentences) + Key Findings (numbered) +
  Recommendation + Next Steps + Appendix (data sources, methodology)
- 1 page target (~500 words)
- **Content source:** Extract all content from source narrative — do not add interpretation or derived metrics
- **Output file:** Write to `outputs/decision_brief_{DATE}.md` where {DATE} is today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., `decision_brief_2026-04-04.md`)

**Format: data**
- Export all DataFrames from `working/` as CSVs to the `outputs/data/` directory
- Filename pattern: Use descriptive names based on what the data represents (e.g., `conversion_by_platform.csv`, `funnel_steps.csv`)
- Create `outputs/data/README.md` documenting each CSV file: columns, row count, use cases, data quality notes
- Do not create extra analysis variants or multiple versions — export only the source DataFrames that were actually used in the analysis
- **Output location:** All CSV files in `outputs/data/` directory plus `outputs/data/README.md` manifest

**Format: gdoc**

Creates a formatted Google Doc from the analysis with embedded charts, styled
headings, internal bookmark links, and SQL code blocks. Follows the Analysis
Readout template: Summary (30-second read) → Analysis (30-minute read) → Resources.

#### Step 0: Auth Check

Check if `mcp__google-docs__*` tools are accessible:

1. Attempt `read_document` on any known document ID (lightweight probe).
2. **If auth works:** Proceed to Step 2a. Say nothing about auth.
3. **If MCP tools unavailable or auth expired:** Say "Connecting your Google
   account..." and run `authorize_google_docs`. Follow the browser OAuth flow.
4. **If auth still fails after one attempt:** Say "Google Docs connection failed.
   Generating a local Word document instead." Fall through to the `docx` format
   (generate .docx only, skip upload). Provide manual upload instructions:
   "You can upload `{docx_path}` to drive.google.com manually."

#### Step 2a: Re-export Detection

Check if `outputs/gdoc_export.yaml` exists:

```python
import yaml, os
from helpers.file_helpers import content_hash

yaml_path = "outputs/gdoc_export.yaml"
if os.path.isfile(yaml_path):
    with open(yaml_path) as f:
        state = yaml.safe_load(f)

    # Check if source has changed
    narrative_path = state.get("source_narrative")
    if narrative_path and os.path.isfile(narrative_path):
        current_hash = content_hash(open(narrative_path).read())
        if current_hash == state.get("source_hash"):
            # Source unchanged — ask user
            url = state.get("document_url", "")
            # Say: "Google Doc already exists at {url}. No analysis changes
            #        detected. Open it, or force re-create?"
            # If user says open: done. If force: continue to Step 2b.
```

#### Step 2b: Parse and Build .docx

```python
from helpers.gdoc_narrative_parser import parse_pipeline_outputs
from helpers.gdoc_builder import build_readout

# Say: "Building document from analysis..."

data = parse_pipeline_outputs(base_dir=".")
docx_path = build_readout(data, output_dir="outputs")

# docx_path is now something like: outputs/report_mobile_checkout_20260403.docx
```

**Confidence gate:** If `data.confidence_grade` is D or F, pause and ask:
"This analysis has low confidence (grade {grade}). The document will include a
prominent caveat. Create anyway?" If the user says no, abort. If yes, continue.

#### Step 2c: Upload to Google Drive

```python
# Say: "Uploading to Google Drive..."

result = mcp__google-docs__upload_file_to_drive(
    file_path=docx_path,
    convert_to_google_doc=True
)
# result: {"file_id": "...", "url": "...", "name": "..."}
```

If upload fails: fall back to .docx. Say: "Drive upload failed. Your analysis
is saved locally at `{docx_path}`."

#### Step 2d: Write State

```python
import yaml
from datetime import datetime
from helpers.file_helpers import content_hash

state_path = "outputs/gdoc_export.yaml"

# Read existing state for version history
existing = {}
if os.path.isfile(state_path):
    with open(state_path) as f:
        existing = yaml.safe_load(f) or {}

version = existing.get("version", 0) + 1
history = existing.get("versions", [])
if existing.get("document_id"):
    history.append({
        "version": existing.get("version"),
        "document_id": existing.get("document_id"),
        "document_url": existing.get("document_url"),
        "created_at": existing.get("created_at"),
    })

narrative_path = _find_latest("narrative_*.md", "outputs")
state = {
    "document_id": result["file_id"],
    "document_url": result["url"],
    "title": data.title,
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "source_narrative": narrative_path,
    "source_hash": content_hash(open(narrative_path).read()) if narrative_path else None,
    "local_docx": docx_path,
    "charts_embedded": sum(
        1 for f in data.findings
        for sf in f.sub_findings
        if sf.chart_path and os.path.isfile(sf.chart_path)
    ),
    "version": version,
    "versions": history,
}

with open(state_path, "w") as f:
    yaml.dump(state, f, default_flow_style=False)
```

#### Step 2e: Post-Upload Verification

After upload, do a quick read-back check:

```python
doc_text = mcp__google-docs__read_document(document_id=result["file_id"])
```

Quick checks:
- Does the text contain the analysis title?
- Does the text contain "Summary" and "Analysis" headings?
- Does `[Chart:` appear? (indicates missing chart placeholders made it in)
- Is the document length reasonable (> 500 chars)?

If any check fails, append a note to the report: "Note: some formatting may not
have survived conversion. Review the document for any issues."

#### Step 3: Report to User

Say:
```
Your analysis is ready:
  Google Doc: {url}
  Local backup: {docx_path}

  Sections: {N findings} findings + recommendations
  Charts: {N} embedded
  Version: {version}

The .docx file is saved locally as a backup. You can share the Google Doc
link with your team.
```

If this was a re-export, also mention: "This is version {N}. Previous versions
are tracked in `outputs/gdoc_export.yaml`."

**Format: docx**

Same as `gdoc` Steps 2a-2b only (parse + build .docx). Skip auth, upload, and
state tracking. Report the .docx path to the user.

Say: "Word document saved at `{docx_path}`. You can upload it to Google Drive
manually or share it directly."

**Format: notion**

Creates a Notion page from the analysis with charts, data stamps, and provenance toggle
blocks. Follows the Notion Export skill (`.claude/skills/notion-export/skill.md`).

#### Step 0: Notion Auth Check
Check if `mcp__notion__*` tools are accessible. If not: "Notion MCP is not configured."

#### Generation
Invoke the `notion-export` agent with:
- `NARRATIVE`: latest narrative
- `CHART_FILES`: chart PNGs from `outputs/charts/`
- `DATASET`: active dataset
- `PROVENANCE_BLOCKS`: from cross-verification (if available)
- `ANALYSIS_RECEIPT`: receipt path (if Tier 3)

The agent handles Analysis Gallery detection, chart hosting, toggle blocks, and self-check.

Output: `outputs/notion_url_{{DATASET}}_{{DATE}}.txt`

Say: "Analysis exported to Notion: {url}. {N} findings with charts and provenance."

**Format: receipt**

Generates a full analysis receipt — the Reproduce-level audit trail. Contains every
query, methodology decision, cross-verification result, and confidence factor breakdown.

#### Prerequisites
- Query log must exist (`working/query_log_*.jsonl`)
- Validation report must exist (`outputs/validation_*.md`)
- If neither exists: "Cannot generate receipt. Run a full analysis first."

#### Tier 3 Pre-Export Gate
If the analysis was run at Tier 3, the receipt is generated automatically at step 18.5.
Check if `outputs/analysis_receipt_*.md` already exists:
- If exists and source unchanged: "Receipt already generated at {path}. Open it, or force re-create?"
- If exists but source changed: Regenerate

#### Generation
Invoke the `receipt-generator` agent with:
- `QUERY_LOG`: most recent query log JSONL
- `VALIDATION_REPORT`: most recent validation report
- `CROSS_VERIFICATION_REPORT`: cross-verification YAML (if available)
- `PIPELINE_STATE`: pipeline state JSON (if available)

Output: `outputs/analysis_receipt_{{DATASET_NAME}}_{{DATE}}.md`

Say: "Analysis receipt generated at `{path}`. Contains {N} findings, {N} queries, and full validation breakdown."

**Format: all**
- Run email + slack + brief + data sequentially
- Skip slides if already exists
- Does NOT include gdoc or receipt (external resource creation must be explicit)
- After completion, suggest: "Want to also create a Google Doc? Run `/export gdoc`. Need a full audit trail? Run `/export receipt`."

### Step 3: Post-Export
- List all exported files with paths
- Suggest: "Copy the email to your clipboard?" or "Want to adjust the tone?"
- For gdoc/docx: suggest sharing or other export formats

## Rules
1. Never fabricate findings — only use data from actual analysis outputs
2. Always cite the source analysis date and dataset
3. Adapt detail level to format (email = high-level, brief = medium, data = raw)
4. Apply Stakeholder Communication skill for all text outputs
5. If the analysis had confidence scores, include them in brief format
6. The `gdoc`, `notion`, and `receipt` formats create external resources or audit trails — never include them in `/export all`
7. Always generate the .docx before attempting Google upload (local fallback)
8. If `outputs/gdoc_export.yaml` shows unchanged source, offer to open existing doc

## Edge Cases
- **Partial analysis:** Export what's available, note gaps: "Note: validation step was not completed."
- **Multiple analyses in outputs/:** Use the most recent by date, or ask user which one
- **Charts missing:** Text formats still work, note: "Charts not available for this export."
- **User requests unknown format:** List available formats and ask to choose
- **gdoc with no Google auth:** Fall back to docx format automatically
- **gdoc re-export, source unchanged:** Offer to open existing doc or force re-create
- **gdoc re-export, source changed:** Create new doc, preserve version history
- **Confidence D/F on gdoc:** Warn user before creating doc (only checkpoint in gdoc flow)
- **Offline / no network:** Generate .docx only. Say: "Saved as Word doc. Upload to Drive when you're back online."
